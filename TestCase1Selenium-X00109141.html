You can also find a list of previous releases, source code, and additional information for Maven users (Maven is a popular Java build tool).<br /> Selenium IDE Selenium IDE is a Firefox plugin which records and plays back user interactions with the browser. Use this to either create simple scripts or assist in exploratory testing. It can also export Remote Control or WebDriver scripts, though they tend to be somewhat brittle and should be overhauled into some sort of Page Object-y structure for any kind of resiliency.<br /> Download latest released version 2.8.0 released on 29/Sep/2014 or view the Release Notes and then install some plugins.<br /> Download previous version 2.7.0 released on 14/Sep/2014.<br /> Selenium Server (formerly the Selenium RC Server) The Selenium Server is needed in order to run either Selenium RC style scripts or Remote Selenium Webdriver ones. The 2.x server is a drop-in replacement for the old Selenium RC server and is designed to be backwards compatible with your existing infrastructure.<br /> Download version 2.44.0 <br /> To use the Selenium Server in a Grid configuration see the wiki page.<br /> The Internet Explorer Driver Server This is required if you want to make use of the latest and greatest features of the WebDriver InternetExplorerDriver. Please make sure that this is available on your $PATH (or %PATH% on Windows) in order for the IE Driver to work as expected.<br /> Download version 2.44.0 for (recommended) 32 bit Windows IE or 64 bit Windows IE<br /> CHANGELOG<br /> Selenium Client &amp; WebDriver Language Bindings In order to create scripts that interact with the Selenium Server (Selenium RC, Selenium Remote Webdriver) or create local Selenium WebDriver script you need to make use of language-specific client drivers. These languages include both 1.x and 2.x style clients.<br /> While language bindings for other languages exist, these are the core ones that are supported by the main project hosted on google code.<br /> Language Client Version Release Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java 2.44.0 2014-10-23 Download&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change log&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javadoc C# 2.44.0 2014-10-23 Download Change log API docs Ruby 2.43.0 2014-09-09 Download Change log API docs Python 2.44.0 2014-10-23 Download Change log API docs Javascript (Node) 2.44.0 2014-10-23 Download Change log API docs C# NuGet NuGet latest release is 2.44.0, Released on 2014-10-23<br /> RC WebDriver WebDriverBackedSelenium Support <br /> Third Party Drivers, Bindings, and Plugins Selenium can be extended through the use of plugins.
